# Motor control
kai-motor-driver houses all the low-level code motor control code that is ran on an [Makerbase XDrive MINI] (https://makerbase3d.com/product/makerbase-xdrive-mini-high-precision-brushless-servo-motor-controller-based-on-odrive3-6-with-as5047p-on-board/).
These drivers have an included AS5047 magnetic encoder, and an STM32. Perfect for running SimpleFOC on it.
Code has been partially adapted from [multisystem](https://community.simplefoc.com/u/multisystem/summary)
